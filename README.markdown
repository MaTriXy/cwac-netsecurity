# CWAC-NetSecurity: Simplifying Secure Internet Access

This project has been discontinued.

For certificate pinning, consider just using [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp)
and its [built-in support for certificate pinning](https://square.github.io/okhttp/https/#certificate-pinning-kt-java).

If you need certificate pinning elsewhere, consider [TrustKit-Android](https://github.com/datatheorem/TrustKit-Android).

If you still wish to use this library despite its discontinued status,
continue on to [the original project `README`](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-netsecurity/blob/master/README-original.markdown).
